`go-centrifuge` is the go implementation of the Centrifuge OS interacting with the peer to peer network, Centrifuge Chain, and our Ethereum smart contracts. 

**Getting help:** Head over to our developer documentation at [developer.centrifuge.io](http://developer.centrifuge.io) to learn how to setup a node and interact with it. If you have any questions, feel free to join our [discord](https://centrifuge.io/discord) 

**DISCLAIMER:** The code released here presents a very early alpha version that should not be used in production and has not been audited. Use this at your own risk.

## Pre-requisites
- Go >= 1.15.x
- Nodejs 10.x.x
- Truffle 5.1.29
- Dapp tools

## Running tests
There 4 different flavours of tests in the project
- Unit tests(unit)
- Command-line tests(cmd)
- Integration tests(integration)
- Environment tests(testworld): spins up multiple go-centrifuge nodes and local ethereum and centrifuge chains

To run all the test flavours: `make run-tests`

To run specific test flavour: `test=unit make run-tests`

To force ethereum smart contracts to be deployed again: `FORCE_MIGRATE='true' test=cmd make run-tests`

Note: `unit` tests doesn't require any smart contract deployments and when run with only `unit` flavour, smart contracts are not deployed.

## Spin-up local environment:
To spin-up local environment, run `make start-local-env`
This command will start Centrifuge chain node, Geth node, and bridge using docker.

## Create config file and Start centrifuge node locally:
To start centrifuge node locally, follow the steps below:
- Start the local test environment
- run `make start-local-node`
This will start a local centrifuge node. It will override any previous configs that were created.
  
## Spin-down local environment:
To spin-down local environment, run `make stop-local-env`
This command will stop Centrifuge chain node, Geth node, and bridge if running.

## Installation
To install, run `make install` will compile project to binary `centrifuge` and be placed under `GOBIN`.

Ensure `GOBIN` is under `PATH` to call the binary globally.
